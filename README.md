# Angular 2 Form Validation

This is a demo app showing how you can create and validate forms with Angular 2. There are four different forms:

1. Template Driven Form
2. Model Driven (Reactive) Form
3. Model Driven (Reactive) Form with Validation
4. Login Form that integrates the [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com?utm_source=scotch.io&utm_medium=sp&utm_campaign=angular2_forms)

To get the Login Form to function properly, you will need to have an Auth0 account, you can sign up for a [free Auth0 account here](https://auth0.com/signup?utm_source=scotch.io&utm_medium=sp&utm_campaign=angular2_forms). Once you have an account go into the `app.login.ts` file and make the following edits:

1. Replace `YOUR-AUTH0-CLIENT-ID` with your credentials
2. Replace `YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN` with your Auth0 domain
3. Replace `YOUR-DATABASE-CONNECTION` with whatever you name your username and database connection in the [Auth0 Management Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com)

Happy Coding!
